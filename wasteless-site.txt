SKETCH PAGES OUT ALREADY 





1. Use Images 
Captivating, relevant images can be a great way to spark engagement and reach for your page and posts.

2. Keep it Interesting
Most people unlike a page because the posts are uninteresting. Keep your fans engaged by posting content that meets their needs or addresses their pain points. Industry news, product releases, and behind the scenes content can pique interest.

3. Use Facebook Social Plugins
Use Facebook's Page Plugin (formerly the “Like” box) on your other socials sites, website and blog. A like button next to your blog post will increase shares, but the Page Plugin can help you boost likes.

4. Add A Link To All of Your Emails
Make sure to include a link to your company page in every email you send out. Your email signature is the perfect place so it's automatically added to every email sent.

5. Invite Your Subscriber and Customer Lists
If you offer a subscription, like a newsletter, make sure to invite your subscribers. They're already interested enough to subscribe. Ask them to “Join our Facebook Community” or “Write on our Facebook wall” instead of the usual “join our fan page.”

6. Engage With Similar Pages 
Engagement works two ways. Regularly leave insightful comments to relevant posts related to your area of expertise. Make sure your comment comes from your company page not your personal page.

7. Cross Promote on Other Social Sites 
Be creative. A simple “like us on Facebook” might not be enough. Point your Twitter followers or LinkedIn connections to relevant content or discussions happening on your page for a more powerful impact.

8. Use Contests
Contests are a great way to get people to like your page. Make sure the prize has perceived value. Promote your contest through your email list and website and make liking your page a contest requirement.

9. Tell Don't Sell, Use the 80/20 Rule 
Keep your promotional content to a minimum. Stick to interesting content rather than selling. Use the 80/20 rule. Make 80 percent of your content informational and informative and the other 20% promotional.

10. Link From Your Personal Page
Link to your company page from your personal page. Create a link from your place of employment.

11. Keep Posts Short and Sweet 
Some research suggests shorter posts (100-120 characters) result in the highest engagement. Other research suggest 40 characters or less!

12. Ask Fans To Tag Photos 
If you host live events, take plenty of pictures, load them on your company page and ask fans to tag themselves. This pushes your wall out to their friends and provides plenty of free exposure!

13. Embed Videos!
Facebook's video feature is powerful. You can load your video directly to your company page and then take the source code and embed it on your blog or website. Consider explainer videos, videos of events or anything of value.

14. Offer Discounts
Exclusive discounts for Facebook fans are a great incentive. In fact 42% of people say that they like a company page for the exclusive coupons and discounts.

15. Make it Personal
From time to time, get personal. People want to know the people behind a business. They're more likely to engage with a person than a brand.

16. Put Your Link In Other Media
If you do any print or radio advertising include your Facebook address. Make sure you include it on business cards, letterhead, magazine ads, brochures, and any other materials.

17. If You Have a Physical Location Display It
If you have a store, display a “like us on Facebook” Placard on the counter. You can incentivize customers to join immediately by offering a discount if they join on their mobile device from your location.

18. Regularly Check Facebook Insights
This can help you keep track of what content is driving engagement and resonating with your audience. Find the posts that have worked the best and share this type of content more often.

19. Optimize Your Page's SEO 
Just like your website, you can optimize your Facebook page for search. Use relevant keywords in your title and About section. Make sure your profile is complete and has a consistent name, address and phone number. Link to your page from your website and other social media accounts.

20. Create a Facebook Group
Topical groups can be an excellent way to reach prospects and increase engagement. Create an industry related group directed at your target audience and use it to build relationships and trust.

21. Tag Other Pages In Your Posts
When you tag other pages, your posts appear on their wall and may spark interest for your brand from the owner's community.

22. Offer True Value
Post content that meets a need for your readers, your posts will get liked and shared and this engagement will lead to new likes for your page. Pay attention to what's happening in your industry and offer unique insights.

23. Comment on Blogs in Your Niche
Leave insightful comments on other blogs in your niche. Make sure to link to your company Facebook page when asked for a URL.

24. “Autograph “Your Posts
When you post on other walls, add an @ tag for your company page as a way to sign off.

25. Add A “Like Us on Facebook” Link To The “Thank You” Page On Your Website 
Customers are more likely to engage when they've just made a purchase they're happy about.

26. Cross Promote 
Form a partnership with a complimentary page in your niche. Agree to cross promote to help each other.

27. Join Relevant Industry Groups
Engaging on groups related to your business can drive traffic to your company page. If readers like what you have to say they will hover over your name and see your about page, which should include your company page URL.

28. Use Hashtags 
They don't work as well on Facebook as they do on Twitter, but they can still attract new fans.

29. Email Invites
Write a short email inviting your contacts to connect with your business on Facebook .

30. Post Regularly
Posting sporadically sends a bad message. If you want people to invest their time in your page establish a regular pattern of posting useful valuable content.

Facebook can be an excellent source of business if you invest your time wisely. These thirty tips are a start. The best way to add fans and attract likes is to post often and provide value. Always make sure to direct people to your website and remember, building likes takes time. Daily consistent practice will pay off!







For a lot of us, the beach is our happy place. It’s where we go to soak up the sun, to frolic in the water, or to take long walks to help us mull over major decisions. Some of us are lucky enough to live right by a beach; for others, it’s a once-a-year kind of treat.

Naturally, we feel a little protective of our beaches. We’re shocked to see that some people don’t care as much about our beaches as we do. When we spot trash and debris littering our beloved beaches, it’s upsetting—not only because it damages the beauty of the beach, but also because it hurts the fragile ecosystems that call the beach home.

If all of this rings true to you, then maybe it’s time to spearhead a beach clean up. Gather up some fellow beach lovers and bring your community together with a day devoted to giving back to something that gives you so much. Here’s what you need to do to organize your own beach clean up—warm fuzzy feeling included.

Pick a Date
The best time to plan a beach clean up is at the start of the season, to ready it for the crowds to enjoy, or at the end of the season, to pick up what the aforementioned crowds may have left behind. Pick a day in late spring or early fall that will fit with most people’s schedules.

Pick a Time
Low tide is the best time to schedule a beach clean up, since that’s when trash is most exposed. Start your event as the tide is starting to go out.

Get Okay-ed
Since you’re doing a good thing, it shouldn’t be hard to get approval from local officials—but be sure to do so anyway. Determine who the right contact is for your beach, and give them a call or shoot them an e-mail outlining your plans. If you’re not sure who to contact, touch base with your municipality or the local police station.

Build a Crusade
Enlist the help of friends and family members who feel similarly about the cause. Reach out to environmental groups in your area who might be willing to support you. Organizing a beach clean up is best done as a team effort.

Spread the Word
With the help of your team, start publicizing your beach clean up. The local paper is a great place to start, as are bulletin boards, Facebook groups, and websites that cover local events. Get in touch with residents who live near the beach, and with groups that are frequent users of the beach, like surfers, SUPers, and other water-users.

Gather Supplies
As the organizer, you should be prepared to provide gear for your volunteers to collect the garbage. Trash bags and gloves are a must. Rakes, sifters, and shovels are useful tools to have on hand. Don’t forget to coordinate extra supplies that will keep your volunteers happy and safe, like snacks, drinks, first aid supplies, and lots of sunscreen.

Think Logistics
Plan out the schedule for the clean up session, and think about what logistics you need to arrange. For instance, if you’re expecting a big crew, consider whether there is enough parking, or if you should plan to organize shuttles or encourage people to walk or bike to the beach. Set up a plan for dividing the beach into sections, and assigning sections to volunteers. Have a game plan for disposing of the trash after the event is done.

Make it Fun
Picking garbage up isn’t necessarily the most glamorous task, so reward your volunteers with a good time. Music can help set the atmosphere, and plan for prizes for the person who collected the most trash, or who found the most unusual piece of garbage. Invite local media to cover the event.

Share Your Success
Brag about the hard work your volunteers have accomplished: use social media and write letters to local publications to publicize your team’s efforts and results. Be sure to thank everyone who helped pitch in the clean up the beach. Don’t forget to pat yourself on the back, too!
